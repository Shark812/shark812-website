After several years in product management, here are the key insights that have shaped my approach to building successful products.

## 1. Users rarely know exactly what they want

When users tell you what they want, they're often describing a solution rather than their actual problem. Dig deeper to understand the underlying need.

## 2. Data and intuition both matter

The best product decisions come from balancing quantitative data with qualitative insights and experienced intuition.

## 3. Saying no is as important as saying yes

Every feature you add creates complexity. Learning to say no to good ideas that don't align with your product strategy is crucial.

## 4. Communication is your most important skill

Your ability to clearly communicate vision, priorities, and tradeoffs will determine your success more than any technical skill.

## 5. Products are never finished

The best products continuously evolve. Embrace iteration and view launches as beginnings, not endings.
