You don't need a big budget or specialized tools to conduct effective user research. These approaches have helped me gather valuable insights.

## The five whys

When a user tells you something, ask "why?" Then ask why again. And again. Five layers deep often reveals surprising insights.

## Contextual inquiry

Watch people use your product (or competitors) in their natural environment. The gap between what people say and what they do is where the insights live.

## Guerrilla testing

Grab a prototype and find 5 people in a coffee shop. Even informal testing with the wrong users is better than no testing at all.

## Customer support mining

Support tickets and chat logs contain gold. I regularly review them to find patterns in user confusion and frustration.

## The mom test

Frame questions to prevent people from being nice to you. Ask about past behaviors rather than future intentions.
