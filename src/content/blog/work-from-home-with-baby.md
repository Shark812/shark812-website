My daughter turns one this month. Since I work fully remote and my husband has a hybrid schedule, we decided early on to keep her at home rather than enroll her in daycare. It hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been incredibly rewarding. We've been there for every milestone, avoided the high cost of daycare, and had more flexibility to shape her daily routine.

Before returning from maternity leave, I spent hours online searching for tips on working from home with a baby. Most of what I found was geared toward moms with side hustles or flexible, self-employed schedules. But I work a more traditional 9-to-5 with meetings and set hours, and there wasn’t much advice out there for someone in my position.

I was thankful to have four months of maternity leave to prepare for the transition back to full-time work. Now, after eight months of working from home with a baby, I’ve learned a lot through trial and error. We've had smooth days and challenging ones, but we’ve found a rhythm that works. If you're also navigating full-time remote work with a baby at home, here are three strategies that helped make it possible for me and might work for you too.

## 1. Mom’s Attitude

Parents set the tone of the home. If you’re a working mom hoping to keep your child at home while managing a full-time job, your mindset matters more than you might think. Starting from a place of discouragement can make everything feel harder.

While I don’t subscribe to the “fake it ’til you make it” philosophy, I do believe in managing my emotions so they don’t overtake me. On days when my daughter hasn’t slept well and I start off feeling irritable, that mood affects everything. Even as a baby, she can sense my frustration. But when I begin the day with a positive mindset and communicate that to her, things often go more smoothly.

As a Christian, I begin my day in prayer, asking for strength, patience, and the ability to do my work in a way that honors God (Colossians 3:23-24). I also pray for my daughter to have a good day and for wisdom in parenting her well. When things start to go sideways, I try to pause, reset, and remind myself of those goals.


## 2. Clear Expectations

When I returned to work, I made sure my employer knew that my daughter would be home with me during the week. Two days a week, I would be solo while my husband was in the office. I wasn’t presenting this as an excuse—just giving them a clear picture of my situation. If you plan to care for your child while working remotely, I highly recommend being upfront about it. Setting expectations early can go a long way in building trust.

I also set expectations with my daughter. Even though she’s still a baby, I believe she understands more than we often give her credit for. I talk to her throughout the day and explain what I’m doing. If I’m about to join a meeting, I tell her that I’ll be talking and won’t be able to play, and that I need her to entertain herself for a little while. Those little moments of communication helped lay the foundation for something important: independent play.

## 3. Teaching and Encouraging Independent Play

One of the biggest turning points for me was when my daughter started playing independently (around 6 months). Honestly, I didn’t do much to “teach” her this skill. I simply let her explore on her own, leaving her with toys in my office while I worked and kept an eye on her. She’d fuss a little, but over time she learned that I wasn’t going to drop everything and play with her. Instead, she started finding her own ways to entertain herself.

The key has been finding toys that she enjoys and encouraging her to keep playing, even when she gets bored. This has been a win-win: I’m able to work more efficiently, and she’s learning to be independent and imaginative. It’s been amazing to see her creativity grow as she figures out new ways to play.

## Things I Don’t Do

In this section, I’ll share a few things I don’t do that others might recommend.

First, my daughter isn’t on a strict nap schedule. This flexibility works well for me because I don’t have a rigid meeting schedule, so she can nap at times that fit better around my workday.

Second, we don’t rely on outside help. No babysitters or relatives watch her regularly. This has made both me and my daughter more adaptable, as we’ve learned to adjust to whatever the day brings.

Lastly, she doesn’t have specific play areas. My entire office doubles as her play space. Now that she’s walking, we’ve put a baby gate by the stairs, but she’s free to roam the upper level, which is all baby-proofed. She loves being able to explore on her own.

## Conclusion

I’m so grateful that my husband and I decided to keep our daughter at home while we work. While this arrangement may not be for everyone, I encourage any working mom considering it to know that you are more capable than you think. Managing a traditional 9-5 while caring for a baby at home comes with its challenges, but with the right mindset and some flexibility, it’s absolutely possible. I hope these tips offer some practical advice and encouragement as you navigate the balance between work and motherhood.
