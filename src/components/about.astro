            By day, Iâ€™m a product manager, 
            driving end-to-end product development. 
            I focus on deeply understanding user needs, 
            bridging design and engineering, and ensuring fast, 
            high-quality execution to build products customers love.
        </p>

            On the side, I'm building apps and websites with AI and write about
            the intersections of Christianity and technology. Iâ€™m endlessly
            curious about the world and the people in it, because I know we were placed
            in this moment in time for a reason.

            In my free time, Iâ€™m with family,
            gathering eggs from my backyard chickens,
            listening to podcasts,
            meeting friends at a coffee shop (for the vibes, not the coffee),
            or playing a board game.
